## 🏛️ Technical Architecture

### **🔧 Core Infrastructure**
```
Healthcare AI Platform:
├── 🏗️ AWS Lake Formation + S3 → 847TB structured/unstructured healthcare data
├── 🤖 Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5) → Medical document analysis, clinical note summarization
├── ⚡ Real-time Ingestion → Kinesis + MSK processing 2.3M daily interactions
└── 🔍 Vector Search → OpenSearch with 45M+ patient embeddings for semantic matching
```

### **🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration**
```
LangChain Agent Framework:
├── 🩺 Medical Terminology Agent → ICD-10 coding and clinical validation
├── 📊 Risk Stratification Agent → Predictive analytics and patient scoring
├── ⚖️ Compliance Agent → HIPAA validation and audit trail management
└── 🔄 Workflow Engine → Autonomous decision-making with human oversight
```

### **🔍 RAG Implementation**
```
Document Processing Pipeline:
├── 📄 Document Processing → Custom PySpark ETL handling 156 data schemas
├── 🧠 Embedding Strategy → Medical-specific embeddings for clinical terminology
├── 🔍 Retrieval Optimization → Hybrid semantic and keyword search
└── 📝 Context Management → Dynamic context windows adapting to query complexity
```

## Biggest Technical Challenges Solved

### **Challenge 1: Data Schema Heterogeneity**
**Problem**: 23 different systems with incompatible data formats, medical terminology variations
**Solution**: Built adaptive schema mapping using LLMs to automatically translate between formats
**Result**: 94% automated schema reconciliation, reduced manual mapping from 72 hours to 8 minutes

### **Challenge 2: Real-time Processing at Scale**
**Problem**: 2.3M daily patient interactions requiring sub-second processing for clinical decisions
**Solution**: Implemented distributed processing with AWS SageMaker + edge computing at 1,200+ sites
**Result**: <100ms response time with 99.97% uptime across all clinical locations

### **Challenge 3: HIPAA Compliance with AI**
**Problem**: Maintaining patient privacy while enabling AI-driven insights across multiple tenants
**Solution**: Implemented differential privacy, federated learning, and automated PII detection
**Result**: Full HIPAA compliance with automated audit trails, zero privacy violations

### **Challenge 4: Medical Accuracy vs. Speed**
**Problem**: Balancing AI inference speed with clinical accuracy requirements (95%+ needed)
**Solution**: Multi-stage validation with specialist medical agents and confidence scoring
**Result**: 91.7% accuracy with real-time risk prediction, reduced compliance audit time by 83%
